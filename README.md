# neware-api

## Overview
`neware-api` provides a Python API and command line interface (CLI) to control Neware cylers.

It is designed for BTS 8.0 and WHW-200L-160CH-B systems, and should work on other cyclers using BTS 8.0.

## Features
- CLI and Python API
- Connect to Neware cyclers
- Retrieve status, data, logs
- Start and stop experiments

## Installation
Install on a Windows PC with BTS server and client 8.0, connected to one or more Neware cyclers with the API activated.

In a Python >3.12 environment, run:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/EmpaEconversion/neware-api.git
```

## CLI usage

See commands and arguments with
```
neware --help
neware <COMMAND> --help
```

E.g. to check the status of all channels use
```
neware status
```

To start a job use
```
neware start "pipeline_id" "my_sample" "my_protocol.xml"
```

A `pipeline` is defined by `{Device ID}-{Sub-device ID}-{Channel ID}`, e.g. `"100-2-3"` for machine 100, sub-device 2, channel 3.

## API usage

Commands are also available through Python, e.g.
```python
python from neware_api import NewareAPI

with NewareAPI() as nw:  # connect to the instrument
    nw.start(
        "pipeline_id",
        "my_sample",
        "my_protocol.xml",
    )
```
